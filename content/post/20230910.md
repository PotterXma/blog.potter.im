# Introduction

The main point of the series od these blogs is to set a goal of understanding and studying the Kubernetes (k8s) source code.

Version: [v1.28.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/v1.28.1)

## K8S Project Folder Structure

[![Alt text](/images/20230910-kubernetes-repo-folder-structure.png)](/images/20230910-kubernetes-repo-folder-structure.png)

The [Kubernetes repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) is the main repository for the Kubernetes project. Here's a brief overview of the folder structure:

- **api**: Contains the OpenAPI spec files for Kubernetes.
- **build**: Includes tools and scripts for building Kubernetes.
- **cluster**: Contains tools and scripts used for building, testing, and deploying a Kubernetes cluster.
- **cmd**: Holds the source code for all Kubernetes components, such as `kube-apiserver`, `kube-scheduler`, `kube-controller-manager`, `kubelet`, `kube-proxy`, `kubectl`, and others.
- **docs**: Documentation files.
- **hack**: Contains scripts and tools used for building and testing Kubernetes.
- **logo**: Contains the logo assets.
- **pkg**: Contains the core libraries and tools code for Kubernetes.
- **plugin**: Holds the source code for Kubernetes plugins, like authentication and authorization plugins.
- **staging**: Contains temporary code for some core libraries, which are periodically published to their respective top-level k8s.io repositories.
- **test**: Contains the source code for Kubernetes tests and testing tools.
- **third_party**: Contains third-party tools used by Kubernetes.
- **vendor**: Contains all dependency library code used by Kubernetes.

## kube-apiserver

### Overview of `kube-apiserver`

The kube-apiserver is the main management component of Kubernetes. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which is the primary entry point for commands and queries against the cluster. Here are some of its roles:

- Authenticating and authorizing requests
- Validating and processing API requests
- Storing the state of the system in etcd (the data store for Kubernetes)

### Directory Structure

The source code of Kubernetes is hosted on GitHub, and the `kube-apiserver` code resides mainly in the `cmd/kube-apiserver` directory. This directory contains the main entry point and setup for the kube-apiserver.

###  `kube-apiserver/apiserver.go`

This is the main entry point for the `kube-apiserver`. It sets up the command to start the server and includes the configuration options.

```go
func main() {
	command := app.NewAPIServerCommand()
	code := cli.Run(command)
	os.Exit(code)
}
```

1. `app.NewAPIServerCommand()`: This function creates a new [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) command object that represents the `kube-apiserver`. This command, when run, will start the API server.
2. `cli.Run(command)`: This function runs the given command and likely handles any errors or setup required before the command executes. It returns an exit code.
3. `os.Exit(code)`: This exits the program with the provided exit code. In Unix-like operating systems, an exit code of 0 typically means success, while any other value indicates an error.

### `kube-apiserver/app/server.go`

This file includes the `func NewAPIServerCommand() *cobra.Command {}` that creates and returns a new `*cobra.Command` object.

#### Function Declaration:

```go
func NewAPIServerCommand() *cobra.Command {
```

The function doesn't take any arguments and returns a pointer to a `cobra.Command`.

#### Initialize Server Run Options:

```go
s := options.NewServerRunOptions()
```
Here, it's creating a new server run options object. This likely contains configuration and settings specific to running the API server.

Let's make a `breakpoint` and see what these options are:

[![Alt text](/images/20230910-kube-apiserver-options.png)](/images/20230910-kube-apiserver-options.png)

For detailed options: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/

#### Command Initialization:

```go
cmd := &cobra.Command{
	...
}
```

This initializes a new `cobra.Command` object. Let's break down its fields:

- `Use`: The name of the command, `kube-apiserver` in this case.
- `Long`: A detailed description of what the command does.
- `SilenceUsage`: If set to true, the usage won't be printed when an error occurs.
- `PersistentPreRunE`: A function that's run before the main `RunE` function. It's used here to silence client-go warnings.
- `RunE`: The main function that gets executed when the command runs. This is where the primary logic for starting the API server resides.
- `Args`: Validates the arguments passed to the command. If any non-empty arguments are passed, an error is returned.

#### Handling CLI Flags:

```go
fs := cmd.Flags()
namedFlagSets := s.Flags()
...
```

Here, the code is dealing with command-line flags:

1. It gets the flag set associated with the command.
2. Retrieves named flag sets from the server run options.
3. Adds global flags, custom global flags, and other flag sets to the command.

#### Setting Usage and Help:

```go
cols, _, _ := term.TerminalSize(cmd.OutOrStdout())
cliflag.SetUsageAndHelpFunc(cmd, namedFlagSets, cols)
```

This determines the terminal size and sets a custom usage and help function for the command, adjusting for the terminal width.

#### Return the Command:

```go
return cmd
```

Finally, the function returns the initialized `cobra.Command`.
